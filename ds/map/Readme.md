# Map

A Map is a type of fast key lookup __data structure__ that offers a flexible means of indexing into its individual elements. Indices into the elements of a Map are called __keys__. These keys, along with the __data__ values associated with them, are stored within the Map.

- __Construct__ : m := map[key]value{}
- __Insert__    : m[k] = v
- __Lookup__    : v = m[k]
- __Delete__    : delete(m, k)
- __Iterate__   : for k, v := range m
- __Size__      : len(m)
