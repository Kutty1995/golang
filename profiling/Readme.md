# Profiling

We can use the go tooling to inspect and profile our programs. Profiling is more of a journey and detective work. It requires some understanding about the application and expectations. The profiling data in and of itself is just raw numbers. We have to give it meaning and understanding.

## How does a profiler work?

A profiler runs your program and configures the operating system to interrupt it at regular intervals. This is done by sending SIGPROF to the program being profiled, which suspends and transfers execution to the profiler. The profiler then grabs the program counter for each executing thread and restarts the program.

## Profiler do's and donâ€™ts

Before you profile, you must have a stable environment to get repeatable results.

- The Machine must be idle - don't profile on shared hardware, don't browse the web while waiting for a long benchmark to run.
- Watch out for power saving and thermal scaling.
- Avoid virtual machines and shared cloud hosting; they are too noisy for consistent measurements.

If you can afford it, buy dedicated performance test hardware. Rack them, disable all the power management and thermal scaling and never update the software on those machines.

For everyone else, have a before and after sample and run them multiple times to get consistent results.

## Types of Profiling

### CPU Profiling

CPU profiling is the most common type of profile. When CPU profiling is enabled, the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack trace of the currently running goroutines. Once the profile is saved to disk, we can analyse it to determine the hottest code paths. The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

### Memory Profiling

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a heap allocation is made. Memory profiling, like CPU profiling is sample based. By default memory profiling samples 1 in every 1000 allocations. This rate can be changed. Stack allocations are assumed to be free and are not tracked in the memory profile. Because of memory profiling is sample based and because it tracks allocations not use, using memory profiling to determine your application's overall memory usage is difficult.

### Block profiling

Block profiling is quite unique. A block profile is similar to a CPU profile, but it records the amount of time a goroutine spent waiting for a shared resource. This can be useful for determining concurrency bottlenecks in your application. Block profiling can show you when a large number of goroutines could make progress, but were blocked.

### Do not enable more than one kind of profile at a time.
